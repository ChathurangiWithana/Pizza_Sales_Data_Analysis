NOTE
If we want to apply the Month, Quarter, Week filters to the above queries you can use WHERE clause, follow some of below examples:
SELECT pizza_category, SUM (total_price) AS Total_Sales, SUM (total_price) * 100/ (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS Percentage_of_Total_Revenue
from pizza_sales
WHERE MONTH(order_date)=1
GROUP BY pizza_category
## Here WHERE MONTH(order_date)=1 indicates that the output is for the month of January.
WHERE DATEPART(QUARTER ,order_date)=1
## Here WHERE DATEPART(QUARTER ,order_date)=1 indicates that the output is for the FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR.
